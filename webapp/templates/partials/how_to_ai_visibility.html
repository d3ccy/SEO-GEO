      <h4>How to use</h4>
      <p>Enter the <strong>domain</strong> without <code>http://</code> (e.g. <code>numiko.com</code>). Optionally enter a <strong>brand / search query</strong> — the phrase you'd use to search for this brand in an AI engine (e.g. "Numiko digital agency UK"). If left blank, the domain is used as the query.</p>
      <p>Click <strong>Check AI Visibility</strong>. This makes several separate API calls and can take up to 30 seconds — the button is disabled while running.</p>
      <p><em>Note: this tool requires the DataForSEO AI Optimization API plan.</em></p>

      <h4>Understanding the results</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>LLM Mentions</dt>
        <dd>AI-generated questions where the domain was cited as a source. Each entry shows the question, the platform (Google AI Overview or ChatGPT), and the co-cited domains.</dd>
        <dt>ChatGPT Search Result</dt>
        <dd>A live scrape of what ChatGPT returns for the brand query. The green/red banner shows whether your domain appears in the cited sources.</dd>
        <dt>Multi-LLM Comparison</dt>
        <dd>Side-by-side tab view of responses from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity. A ✓ on a tab means the domain was mentioned in that platform's response.</dd>

      <h4>Quick tips</h4>
      <ul class="how-to-tips">
        <li>Try the brand query as both the company name and a service query — results often differ significantly</li>
        <li>If the domain is not mentioned anywhere: the <strong>GEO Audit</strong> and <strong>Content Guide</strong> are your starting points — AI platforms cite sources they've indexed and trust</li>
        <li>Low mention counts are common for smaller agencies — building domain authority via backlinks from industry publications is the primary lever</li>
        <li>Screenshot the LLM responses as evidence for client GEO strategy conversations</li>
        <li>Check monthly, or after a major content or link-building campaign</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Common questions</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>Why do I see "data not available" for some panels?</dt>
        <dd>The AI Visibility panels use the DataForSEO AI Optimization API, which is a separate premium plan. If that plan is not active, panels show "data not available" rather than an error.</dd>
        <dt>The response doesn't mention my client — is that bad?</dt>
        <dd>Not necessarily surprising for smaller or niche organisations. It shows there's GEO work to do. Use the GEO Audit to identify technical gaps, and the Content Guide to improve the content itself.</dd>
        <dt>Can I check a competitor's AI visibility?</dt>
        <dd>Yes — just enter their domain. This can be valuable context: if a competitor is frequently cited by AI, understanding what content they produce is useful for the client's GEO strategy.</dd>
