      <h4>How to use</h4>
      <p>Enter a <strong>domain</strong> without <code>http://</code> (e.g. <code>numiko.com</code>) and choose the <strong>location</strong> — this affects which Google index is used for keyword and competitor data.</p>
      <p>Click <strong>Analyse Domain</strong>. Four API calls run in sequence — allow 10–20 seconds. Run for your client's domain first, then run for each of their top competitors to benchmark.</p>
      <p>In the competitors table, click <strong>Analyse</strong> next to any competitor domain to run a Domain Overview on them directly.</p>

      <h4>Understanding the metrics</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>Domain Rank (0–100)</dt>
        <dd>DataForSEO's authority score based on backlinks. 40+ is solid, 60+ is strong. A low rank with high traffic = content authority without backlink authority.</dd>
        <dt>Est. Traffic / mo</dt>
        <dd>Estimated monthly organic visitors from Google. Use as a relative benchmark — not an absolute traffic figure.</dd>
        <dt>Positions 1–3</dt>
        <dd>Keywords in the top 3 positions. These capture the majority of clicks for any given query.</dd>
        <dt>Referring Domains</dt>
        <dd>More meaningful than total backlinks — counts unique sites linking in. Diversity matters more than volume.</dd>
        <dt>Dofollow vs Nofollow</dt>
        <dd>Only dofollow links pass authority. A high nofollow proportion reduces the SEO value of the backlink profile.</dd>

      <h4>Quick tips</h4>
      <ul class="how-to-tips">
        <li>Run before a project kickoff to establish a baseline — screenshot the metrics</li>
        <li>Run for 2–3 competitors to benchmark where the client sits relative to the market</li>
        <li>"Common Keywords" in the competitors table shows overlap — higher overlap = more direct competition</li>
        <li>A high backlink count with a low referring domains count = most links from a few sites — less diverse = less authoritative</li>
        <li>Sort the keywords table by <strong>Position</strong> to find quick-win keywords ranked 4–10 that could reach position 1–3 with optimisation</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Common questions</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>Why are some sections empty?</dt>
        <dd>Domain Overview uses several DataForSEO endpoints. Some API plans don't include all of them. Sections that fail show "not found" rather than blocking the rest.</dd>
        <dt>The domain rank seems low — is something wrong?</dt>
        <dd>Domain Rank is based on backlinks, not traffic. A site can have good organic traffic with a modest backlink profile. Use rank and traffic together for context.</dd>
        <dt>Can I analyse a competitor's site?</dt>
        <dd>Yes — enter their domain directly. Or click "Analyse" in the competitors table to jump straight to their overview.</dd>
